This is a game that allows 2 players to try and be the first one to 100 points. The current score will continue to go up on each dice roll until a player rolls a 1. Opon rolling a 1, the player will lose their current score and it will be the next player's turn. If a player wants to keep their current score, they can choose to hold and let the next player go.
